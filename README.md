### Semester Goal
This team will be working to find the safe loads and forces for the specific usage using the structural limits of PVC. Using the knowledge that basically every part of the plant that experiences a lot of load (e.g. filter during backwash), then structural analysis can be completed. Those who have experience in Ansys in this team could do analysis regarding these loads. The end goal of this team is to be able to use the smallest (AKA cheapest) pipes throughout the plant. An additional goal would be to find the lifetime of a PVC pipe through fatigue analysis. How often do structural pipes need to be replaced?
